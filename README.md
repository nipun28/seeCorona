Hey there!

I've made an interactive website using HTML, CSS, JS and MAPBOX.
Using a sample dataset(DATA fetched in March 2020), this website shows CoronaVirus severity across different countries in the world during that particular time.
This website analyzes the number of corona-positive people in a particular region and drops a pin over the region whose colour indicates about the magnitude of the infected patients there.


Implication of various colours:

    Green: Infected poulation between 0 - 100
    Light Green: Infected poulation between 101 - 250
    Yellow: Infected poulation between 251 - 500
    Orange: Infected poulation between 501 - 1000
    Red: Infected poulation > 1000
